### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<hr>

Hi I'm Deepshika and I recently graduated from the General Assembly Data Science Immersive course.
My passion for Data Science was sparked when I was self learning Web Development and was able to build a website for image recognition using an API. I have also had the chance of building a model that could predict dog breeds through image recognition.
I find great satisfaction in taking up challenges and solving them using the skills I have learned like Data Exploration/Visualization and using models to make predictions.
Here's a short list of my skills:
* Python
* SQL
* Natural Language Processing
* Deep Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* Jupyter Notebooks
* Github
* Web Scraping
